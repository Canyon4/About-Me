## Projects: 
-  Morse Code - *(https://github.com/Canyon4/MorseCode)*
	There are two programs. morse.py translates an input, the user gives, to morse code and uses a buzzer to express the morse code. the other program, buttonMorse.py,
	utilizes a button that, when clicked, will send a signal to the buzzer to sound off. Making it so that the user can make their own morse code phrases.
	From this project, I learned how to stay diligent and on task which can be useful in other projects.
